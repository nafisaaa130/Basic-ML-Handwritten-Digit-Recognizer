# Basic ML Handwritten Digit Recognizer

This recognition algorithm utilizes Keras, also well known as a Python deep learning API, helping with training data. More info on Keras on their functionality and documentation can be found here: https://keras.io/api/

Main source code for this recognizer can be found from: https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-deep-learning-project-handwritten-digit-recognition/.

**WORK IN PROGRESS** Working on implementing a more accurate Python GUI for inputting handwritten digits
